PCUI is a general, curvilinear fluids solver (Cui, 1999), combined with an Eulerian-based sediment transport model (Nelson, 2018). A brief description of the code and an outlined example is shown in “pcui_guide.pdf”, however this document is dated and needs to be updated. Code in this repository is currently (4/22/2018) being cleaned. If you intend on adding to the codebase, please check back for an updated version at the end of May.

You will also find a folder named “mfiles” that contains MATLAB processing scripts. Mfile details will be added to the PCUI guide upon updating it. 

PCUI is the code of Cui, 1999. It is the parallelized version of the Zang et al 1994 code.
